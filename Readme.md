# What is Functional Programming?

- In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller functions,
  basic function that can be combined to build complex programs.
- When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions are called _lambda_
- Its is centered around a theory of functions.

- With FP, solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope
  1. Isolated Fuctions:
      - There is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change
  2. Pure Functions:
      - The same input always gives the same output
  3. Functions with limited side effects:
      - Any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled.
  
  Principles of Functional Programming
    - Avoid Mutations and side effects.
    - Pass arguments to avoid to avoid external dependence in a function - functions only dependence on inputs
